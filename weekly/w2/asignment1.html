	<h1>Website Critique</h1>
	<h2>The Bad</h2>
	<img src="imagefile/superpets.png"  alt="super pets" width="50%">
	<p><a href="http://www.superpetsonline.com/products-fish.html">super pets site</a></p>
	
	
	
<p> This website has a good organization within the structure of where people can be directed to the
different animals. The design of the page isn't very good, for it seems unfinished and is not as
pleasing for a pet company. The products of the animals aren't very descriptive, not having a lot
of photos of the pets that are available. As a viewer I wouldn't trust this company with their
product because of how unprofessional the site gives to the viewer from the lack of design and
	pictures.</p>
	
	<h2>The Bad</h2>

	<p><a href="http://mgpr.org/newsite/GP_Info/Guinea%20Pig%20Care.htm">Guinea Pig Care</a></p>

	
<p>This is a good example of a bad design for a web page and also the organization of the information on the page isn't appealing to the viewer. The background of the page is shown thru the words, not leaving a separation of the background and the text and photos on the page, which is very confusing as a viewer. Also the colors of the design, webpage are very unpleasing, not having me interested in the page. The organization as well as directing to the different pages is very confusing and not very organized.</p> 

	
	<h2> The Good</h2>
	<img src="imagefile/microsoft.png" alt="Microsoft" width="360" height="200">
	<p><a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/home">Microsoft</a></p>

<p>This is a great website for a company, by the design and great organization that this site contains. This website contains a good organization of a header, body and many more. The color choices are very appealing and also the way for organizations to direct to their products is used very well.</p> 

	<h2> The Good</h2>

<p><a href="https://teddyfresh.com/">Teddyfresh</a></p>
	
<p>This page is very straight forward, having all the products up forward to the viewer. Being organized regarding displaying their own products. Also containing photos which is appealing as well. The site is very organized as well with having all their different products shown and easily accessed for the shoppers. The choices of the colors and design is very appealing as well, allowing the viewers to be really attractive to the company's products.</p>
